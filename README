I am still learning python, and this is my first program that does something useful, so it's not good and has bugs.  But it works well enough.

==What it does==
Plays audio files and asks user to spell the word.  The correct spelling is the filneame (without .ogg)

==How to install and run==

1. install pygame
2. download the files from github
3. > python spell.py

==type exit to exit==
